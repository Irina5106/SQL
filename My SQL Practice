# Here I practice writing different SQL queries:

#1. Show first name, last name, and gender of patients whose gender is 'M':

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  gender
FROM patients
WHERE gender = 'M';

#2. Show first name and last name of patients who does not have allergies. (null):

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name
FROM patients
WHERE allergies IS NULL;

#3. Show first name of patients that start with the letter 'C':

SELECT
  first_name
FROM
  patients
WHERE
  first_name LIKE 'C%';

#4. Show first name and last name of patients that weight within the range of 100 to 120 (inclusive):

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name
FROM patients
WHERE weight BETWEEN 100 AND 120;

#5. Update the patients table for the allergies column. If the patient's allergies is null then replace it with 'NKA':

UPDATE patients
SET allergies = 'NKA'
WHERE allergies IS NULL;

#6. Show first name and last name concatinated into one column to show their full name:

SELECT
  CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM patients;

#7. Show first name, last name, and the full province name of each patient:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  province_name
FROM patients
  JOIN province_names 
  ON province_names.province_id = patients.province_id;

#8. Show how many patients have a birth_date with 2010 as the birth year:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_patients
FROM patients
WHERE YEAR(birth_date) = 2010;

#9. Show the first_name, last_name, and height of the patient with the greatest height:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  MAX(height) AS height
FROM patients;

#10. Show all columns for patients who have one of the following patient_ids: 1,45,534,879,1000:

SELECT *
FROM patients
WHERE patient_id IN (1, 45, 534, 879, 1000);

#11. Show the total number of admissions:

SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_admissions
FROM admissions;

#12. 
Show all the columns from admissions where the patient was admitted and discharged on the same day:

SELECT *
FROM admissions
WHERE admission_date = discharge_date;

#13. Show the patient id and the total number of admissions for patient_id 579:

SELECT
  patient_id,
  COUNT(*) AS total_admissions
FROM admissions
WHERE patient_id = 579;

#14. Based on the cities that our patients live in, show unique cities that are in province_id 'NS':

SELECT DISTINCT(city) AS unique_cities
FROM patients
WHERE province_id = 'NS';

#15. Write a query to find the first_name, last name and birth date of patients who has height greater than 160 and weight greater than 70:

SELECT first_name, last_name, birth_date 
FROM patients
WHERE height > 160 AND weight > 70;

#16. Write a query to find list of patients first_name, last_name, and allergies from Hamilton where allergies are not null:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,
  allergies
FROM patients
WHERE
  city = 'Hamilton'
  AND allergies IS NOT null;

#17. Show unique birth years from patients and order them by ascending:

SELECT
  DISTINCT YEAR(birth_date) AS birth_year
FROM patients
ORDER BY birth_year;

#18. Show unique first names from the patients table which only occurs once in the list:
(For example, if two or more people are named 'John' in the first_name column then don't include their name in the output list. If only 1 person is named 'Leo' then include them in the output):

SELECT first_name
FROM patients
GROUP BY first_name
HAVING COUNT(first_name) = 1;

#19. Show patient_id and first_name from patients where their first_name start and ends with 's' and is at least 6 characters long:

SELECT

WHERE
  first_name like 's%'
  AND first_name like '%s'
  AND len(first_name) >= 6;

OR

SELECT

WHERE diagnosis = 'Dementia';

#21. Display every patient's first_name, order the list by the length of each name and then by alphbetically:

SELECT first_name
FROM patients
OREDER BY
  len(first_name),
  first_name;

#22. Show the total amount of male patients and the total amount of female patients in the patients table, display the two results in the same row:

SELECT 
  (SELECT count(*) FROM patients WHERE gender='M') AS male_count, 
  (SELECT count(*) FROM patients WHERE gender='F') AS female_count;

#23. Show first and last name, allergies from patients which have allergies to either 'Penicillin' or 'Morphine'. Show results ordered ascending by allergies then by first_name then by last_name:

SELECT
  first_name,
  last_name,

WHERE
  allergies IN ('Penicillin', 'Morphine')
ORDER BY
  allergies,
  first_name,
  last_name;

#24. Show the city and the total number of patients in the city, order from most to least patients and then by city name ascending:

SELECT
  city,
  COUNT(*) AS num_patients
FROM patients
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY num_patients DESC, city ASC;

#25. Show all allergies ordered by popularity. Remove NULL values from query:

SELECT
  allergies,
  COUNT(*) AS total_diagnosis
FROM patients
WHERE
  allergies IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY allergies
ORDER BY total_diagnosis DESC;

#26. Show all patient's first_name, last_name, and birth_date who were born in the 1970s decade. Sort the list starting from the earliest birth_date:

SELECT first_name, last_name, birth_date

ORDER BY birth_date ASC;

#27. Display each patient's full name in a single column,  
their last_name in all upper letters must appear first, then first_name in all lower case letters, separate the last_name and first_name with a comma, order the list by the first_name in decending order:

SELECT
  CONCAT(UPPER(last_name), ',', LOWER(first_name)) AS new_name

ORDER BY first_name DESC;

#28. Show the province_id(s), sum of height; where the total sum of its patient's height is greater than or equal to 7,000:
