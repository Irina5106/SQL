# This is my final project in SQLite Studio:

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US:

SELECT CustomerId, FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "USA";

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil:

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = "Brazil";

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil (customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the invoice, and billing country):

SELECT cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, inv.InvoiceId, inv.BillingCountry, inv.InvoiceDate
FROM chinook.invoices inv 
LEFT JOIN chinook.customers cust 
ON inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId 
WHERE inv.BillingCountry = "Brazil";

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Support Agents:

SELECT * FROM chinook.employees
WHERE Title = 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table:

SELECT DISTINCT BillingCountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. Provide a query that shows the invoices associated with each sales agent. The resulting table should include the Sales Agent's full name:

SELECT emp.FirstName||' '||emp.Lastname AS full_name, inv.InvoiceId
FROM chinook.Employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#7. Show the Invoice Total, Customer name, Country, and Sales Agent name for all invoices and customers:

SELECT emp.LastName, emp.Firstname, cust.FirstName, cust.LastName, cust.Country, inv.total
FROM chinook.employees emp 
JOIN chinook.Customers cust ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId;

#8. How many Invoices were there in 2009:

SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM chinook.Invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#9. What are the total sales for 2009:

SELECT SUM(Total)
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

10. Write a query that includes the purchased track name with each invoice line ID:

SELECT t.Name, i.InvoiceLineId
FROM chinook.Invoice_items i
JOIN chinook.Tracks t 
ON i.TrackId = t.TrackId;

#11. Show the total sales made by each sales agent:

SELECT emp.FirstName, emp.LastName,
ROUND(SUM(Inv.Total), 2) as 'Total Sales' 
FROM chinook.Employees emp
JOIN chinook.Customers cust 
ON cust.SupportRepId = emp.EmployeeId
JOIN chinook.Invoices Inv 
ON Inv.CustomerId = cust.CustomerId
WHERE emp.Title = 'Sales Support Agent' 
GROUP BY emp.FirstName;

#12. Show the artists and genre:

SELECT a.name AS artist, g.name AS genre
FROM chinook.artists a
JOIN chinook. genres g
ON g.genreid = a.artistid;

#13. Show customers who live in USA and who has SupportrepId 4 or more:

SELECT * FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country = 'France' AND SupportRepId >=4;

#14. Show only the year of each sale:

SELECT invoiceId, strftime('%Y', invoicedate) AS year
FROM chinook.invoices
ORDER BY invoiceid;

#15. Compare sales in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013:

SELECT 
(SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total))
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31') AS '2009',

(SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total))
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2010-01-01' AND '2010-12-31') AS '2010',

(SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total))
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2011-01-01' AND '2011-12-31') AS '2011',

(SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total))
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2012-01-01' AND '2012-12-31') AS '2012',

(SELECT ROUND(SUM(Total))
FROM chinook.invoices
WHERE InvoiceDate BETWEEN '2013-01-01' AND '2013-12-31') AS '2013';
